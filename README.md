Cognify is an innovative, AI-powered learning platform designed to make learning more efficient and interactive. Inspired by classic flashcard apps but equipped with advanced features, Cognify helps users extract knowledge from a variety of sources and transform it into organized learning modules. The platform offers personalized flashcards, mind maps, and interactive learning videos powered by AI technology, taking the learning experience to a new level.

Key Features of Cognify
AI-Powered Flashcard Creation

Users can upload content from various sources, including text, YouTube videos, or documents, and Cognify’s AI analyzes, extracts, and automatically generates flashcards in different languages.
Multiple types of flashcards are available, including:
Multiple Choice
Classic (Question-Answer)
True or False
Fill-in-the-Blank
Flashcards are automatically translated into the desired language and tailored to the user's level.
Mind Map Generator

Based on uploaded content, Cognify creates mind maps that extract key information and transform it into visual structures.
The mind maps are intelligently linked to connect learning materials and simplify complex topics.
The AI ensures that the mind maps not only summarize but also logically and meaningfully connect the information.
Progress Tracker and Learning Modes

Cognify tracks user progress and clearly displays which cards have been mastered and which need further review.
Each card is categorized into one of three mastery levels:
Level 1 (Beginner): The card is marked red, indicating that the user has not yet mastered the topic.
Level 2 (Intermediate): The card is marked blue, showing that the user partially understands the topic but needs more practice.
Level 3 (Mastery): The card is marked green, indicating that the user has fully grasped the topic.
The platform uses an intelligent algorithm to ensure that cards appear in random order to keep the learning process varied. Once all cards are reviewed, the learning cycle restarts, and the mastery levels are adjusted based on the user’s performance.
Multimedia Learning Modules

For each type of flashcard, there are interactive learning videos that show users how each card type looks and how to use them effectively.
Users can choose from a library of learning videos that explain various learning methods and how to maximize the benefits of the available cards.
